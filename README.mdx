## 🌈 What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe coding is an approach to web development that prioritizes the overall feel and experience of a website over rigid technical specifications. It's about creating a cohesive aesthetic and emotional response through:

- **Intuitive Design**: Creating interfaces that feel natural and enjoyable to use
- **Emotional Connection**: Using colors, typography, and animations that evoke specific feelings
- **Consistent Aesthetics**: Maintaining a unified visual language throughout the application
- **User-Centered Focus**: Prioritizing how the user feels when interacting with the site

In this project, vibe coding is expressed through:
- Soft color palette with vibrant accents
- Smooth transitions and subtle animations
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Thoughtful micro-interactions
